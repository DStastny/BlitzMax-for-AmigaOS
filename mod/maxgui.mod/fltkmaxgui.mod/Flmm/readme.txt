Due to popular request, Flmm_Tabs implements tabs with an arbitrary number of children. When the tab row grows too big, a pulldown menu button shows up to the right of the tabs which allows selection of any child. It is also possible to walk through all tabs by clicking the left or right tab at the very outside border.

Flmm_Tabs is derived from Fl_Tabs and uses precisely the same API.
