CORE DEVELOPER

   Matthias Melcher (mm@matthiasm.com)

I would like to thank the core developers of FLTK and all other contributers. 
Special thanks go to Bill Spitzak who started FLTK as "the insane rewrite
of the Forms Library" for beeing a good friend and coworker, and Mike Sweet 
for managing FLTK, fltk.org, and the mad developer crowd.
