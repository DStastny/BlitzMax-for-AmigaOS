*** NOTE FOR COMPILING ON OSX ***
when compiling the examples on OSX, if you did a local build
(i.e. you did not make install fltk or FLU, and specified
--fltk=/path/to/local/fltk as an option to FLU/configure)
fltk-config (used by examples/Makefile) appears to supply an
incompatible flag to g++. To fix this, you must edit
fltk/fltk-config and change the line:
DSOLINK="-Wl,-rpath,${exec_prefix}/lib"
to
DSOLINK=""

again, this ONLY applies to compiling the examples when you 
HAVE NOT installed either fltk or FLU to the system.
