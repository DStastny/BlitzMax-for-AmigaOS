MaxGUI.Localization is a simple yet powerful localization engine that you can use to localize your applications.
Although the module is designed primarily for use with the MaxGUI toolkit, it is self-contained and so can be 
imported into other BlitzMax games and applications separately, without the overhead of the rest of MaxGUI.


It is recommended that you read through the command set below to familiarize yourself with the module before
use.  

Whenever applicable, MaxGUI coders should use the #LocalizeGadget command in #{MaxGUI.MaxGUI} in favour of 
#LocalizeString to ensure that gadgets are updated when the language or localization settings are changed.
